"""
Connectivity Module.

Creates a 3D connectivity matrix and provide methods to get the connectivity
between two motes.

The connectivity matrix is index by source id, destination id and channel.
Each cell of the matrix is a dict with the fields `pdr` and `rssi`

The connectivity matrix can be filled statically at startup or be updated along
time if a connectivity trace is given.

The propagate() method is called at every slot. It loops through the
transmissions occurring during that slot and checks if the transmission fails or
succeeds.
